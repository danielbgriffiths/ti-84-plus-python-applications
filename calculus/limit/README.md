# My Project

This project is about demonstrating LaTeX in GitHub README using MathJax.

Here's an inline equation: $E = mc^2$

And here's a block equation:

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi} $$

For more complex LaTeX, consider using GitHub Pages with MathJax for better rendering.
